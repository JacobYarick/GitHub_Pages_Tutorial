##First part of an rmarkdown page is the YAML header. This is where you title the page, add an author "add your name", and you can set the date - 2 options system date or a publish date

##Output is how you set the type of document that is exported. This is also where you can add features like styles, tables of contents, and figure dimensions

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

```

# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

```{r}

#install.packages("readxl")
#install.packages("knitr")
#install.packages("tidyverse")

#library(readxl)
#library(knitr)
#library(tidyverse)

```


When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
